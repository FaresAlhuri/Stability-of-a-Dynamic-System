# Stability Analysis of Dynamic Systems using Numerical Integration Methods

## Overview

This project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of different numerical integration methods in solving dynamic differential equations. By comparing the results obtained from the Implicit Euler and Runge-Kutta 4 methods with those from the Explicit Euler method, the project highlights how stability and accuracy can vary. Ultimately, the goal is to showcase how the Implicit Euler and Runge-Kutta 4 methods offer superior performance, with the latter achieving a remarkable 90% similarity to the exact solution of the system's function.

## Project Description

The project contains Python scripts implementing the Implicit Euler, Runge-Kutta 4, and Explicit Euler methods for solving ordinary differential equations. It includes functions to define the system of differential equations, implement the numerical integration methods, perform error analysis, and plot the results.
